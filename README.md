# `which-bond`

> Bond, which Bond?

`which-bond` is a Node.js command line tool for choosing a random James Bond film to watch.

```
$ which-bond

  On Her Majesty's Secret Service

  Starring George Lazenby as James Bond

  James Bond tracks archnemesis Ernst Blofeld to a mountaintop retreat
  where he's training an army of beautiful but lethal women. Along the
  way, Bond falls for Italian contessa Tracy Draco -- and marries her in
  order to get closer to Blofeld. Meanwhile, he locates Blofeld in the
  Alps and embarks on a classic ski chase.

## How to use `which-bond` if you‚Äôre familiar with Node.js and npm

### [Install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

### [Get a TMDb API key](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)

### Add your TMDb API key to `which-bond`

```

*[(Learn about dotenv)](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)*

- Install `which-bond`:

```

*(`which-bond` is a command line tool, hence the [`--global` install](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally))*

- Run `which-bond`:

```
$ which-bond
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: The first time you run `which-bond`, it will download the Bond film data from TMDb and cache it on your computer. It may take around 30 seconds to complete the download, but after that `which-bond` will be very fast. Don't worry, it's not downloading a ton of data, it's just spacing out requests to TMDb so as not to go over their [request rate limit](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/request-rate-limiting). You can look at the database yourself when it's finished. It's just a JSON file called `.db.json`.
